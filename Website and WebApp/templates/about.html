    <h1>THE MESH</h1>
    <p>
        We have come to the cross roads
        And i must either leave or come with you
        I lingered over the choice
        But in the darkness of my doubts
        You lifted up the lamp of love
        And i saw in your face
        The road that i should take
    </p>
